               <p className="font-sora font-extralight text-base leading-9 mb-3">Dynamo is an optimized digital platform providing access to multiple consumer-facing services across various emerging and underserved markets. The platform creates easy access to an aggregated service environment directly and uniquely allows any user to recommend and promote a service to any other eligible user for a reward. This secondary feature was purpose built to accommodate the significant population that are currently digitally handicapped due to poor access to internet; device constraints; or low digital literacy.</p>
               <p className="font-sora font-extralight text-base leading-9 mb-3">As a business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) environment, Dynamo creates efficiency and accountability for the field forces of service providers while decreasing customer acquisition costs. A wealth of data analytics on customer behavior and service distribution is captured that service providers can leverage on for service improvement and distribution.</p>
